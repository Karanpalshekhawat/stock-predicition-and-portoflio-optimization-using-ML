## Predictive Stock Selection and Portfolio Optimization using Machine Learning model

---
An `approach` to build an quantitative alpha trading model to identify best performing stocks and their corresponding
ideal weights from a set of stocks using different machine
learning models and compare their performance on an actual period.

I have implemented ML model and portfolio optimization techniques to analyze their impact on an actual
performance as per below:-

| **Stock Prediction ML model**                  | 
|:-----------------------------------------------|
| **Linear regression using Elastic Net (LRET)** | 
| **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**             |
| **Long-Short Term Memory Network (LSTM)**      |

| **Portfolio Optimization Techniques** |
|:--------------------------------------|
| **Equal Weights (EQ)**                |
| **Monte-carlo simulation (MCS)**      |
| **Mean-variance Optimization (MVO)**  |
