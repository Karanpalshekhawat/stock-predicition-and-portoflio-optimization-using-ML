## Predictive Stock Selection and Portfolio Optimization using Machine Learning model

---
An `approach` to build an quantitative alpha trading model to identify best performing stocks and their corresponding
ideal weights from a set of stocks using different machine
learning models and compare their performance on an actual period.

I have implemented below ML model and portfolio optimization techniques to analyze their impact on an actual
performance.

| Stock Prediction ML model                       | Portfolio Optimization Techniques |
|:------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| **Linear regression using Elastic Net (LRET) ** | Equal Weights (EQ)                |
| **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**              | Monte-carlo simulation (MCS)      |
| **Long-Short Term Memory Network (LSTM)**       | Mean-variance Optimization (MVO)  |
